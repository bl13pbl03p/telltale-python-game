# Telltale Python Game
For the Python Assignment when I was in school, I decided to make a Telltale based style game. In this game you can either gain or lose health points by making the right decisions. To see the explanation for my code you can see the comments that I wrote. Some comments are only written once, otherwise you'll see the same comments all over again.

### Get started
1. Retrieve the script with `git clone https://github.com/bl13pbl03p/telltale-python-game.git`
2. Retrieve all the used modules with `pip3 install -m requirements.txt`
3. Run the script with the command `python3 PythonAssignment.py`

#### What I wanted to add
- Time limit for an answer
- Add an output fluent type effect
- ASCII image
